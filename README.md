# Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning
Pneumonia is a serious respiratory infection causing high mortality worldwide. This project presents Pneumonia Detection Network (PDN), a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for accurate detection and localization of pneumonia in chest X-ray images.
